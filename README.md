# NeuralNetworkHelloWorld
A simple project to identify handwritten or digits.

This project does not use any external libraries. Instead everything is written from scratch for learning purposes.
The book "How to make your own Neural Network" by Tariq Rashid was used as a resource.
Check out his code here: https://github.com/makeyourownneuralnetwork/makeyourownneuralnetwork
The book is available under: https://www.amazon.com/Make-Your-Own-Neural-Network-ebook/dp/B01EER4Z4G and at many other places. You may even find it in your mothertongue since it was translated at least into German.

However I am using c++ instead of python since I wanted to provide an efficient and scalable solution. However, at the current moment, my implementation is not as fast as I want it to be (slower than a similar implementation in Java).

Work in progress...
